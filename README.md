# GLC-BI-project

The GLC BI Project is a medium-sized software solution that encompasses various menus and sections designed to streamline operations for employees across different departments and work units within the GLC company. Its primary functionalities include issuing bills of lading, calculating drivers' wages, managing home delivery and installation technicians' wages, and facilitating payroll calculations.

Additionally, the software features dashboards and visual charts that offer managers a simplified means of overseeing these processes. By leveraging these tools, users can significantly enhance efficiency and productivity within their respective roles.

One of the notable benefits of the GLC BI Project is its ability to drastically reduce the time required for calculations. For instance, what previously took days to compute for nearly 90 technicians can now be accomplished in just half an hour. Furthermore, the software provides an online platform accessible from any location, enabling users to issue bills of lading from multiple points seamlessly.

Moreover, the application empowers branch managers to generate and distribute payrolls for their workforce, fostering transparency and accountability across the organization.
